# Bravo-Compiler
The Bravo Compiler is a custom compiler developed by a group of students as a university project. Implemented using Java, this compiler incorporates object-oriented programming principles and encompasses all basic elements expected in a programming language, including loops, conditionals, functions, and basic data structures and algorithms (DSA).

Key Features:

Language Support: The Bravo Compiler supports a comprehensive set of programming constructs, enabling developers to write code using familiar syntax for loops, conditional statements (if-else), functions, and more.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Leveraging Java's robust OOP features, the compiler facilitates the creation and usage of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, empowering developers to build modular and reusable code.

Compiler Implementation: The compiler translates source code written in the Bravo programming language into executable machine code or intermediate code, facilitating program execution.

Syntax Analysis: Utilizing lexical analysis and syntax parsing techniques, the compiler performs comprehensive syntax analysis to ensure adherence to the Bravo language grammar and semantics.

Code Generation: The compiler generates optimized and efficient code from high-level Bravo language constructs, aiming to enhance program performance and resource utilization.

Error Handling: With robust error detection and reporting mechanisms, the compiler provides informative error messages to aid developers in identifying and rectifying syntax or semantic errors in their code.

Extensibility: Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, the Bravo Compiler architecture allows for future enhancements and the addition of new language features, enabling it to evolve with changing requirements and advancements in programming language design.
